# Python-Defanger
A simple defanger program in python. Got it. Thank you for the clarification. Defanging is used to prevent accidental clicking on IP addresses. It is especially useful when the malicious IPs are dealt with. The program can be integrated in different tools for the purpose of improvement and automation.
